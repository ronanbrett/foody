# Recipe Creator

## Features

- Should allow you to select key ingredients and then allow them to select methods of cooking them
- So the focus is instead of just adding text describing the recipe step, the step is more like an dynamic collection of information, eg the Ingredients used in the step, the utensils used, what this step is going to accomplish for the recipe and how that fits into the overall recipe.
- Recipes are created out of a series of these steps that could be single vertical lane of steps for something like a one skillet recipe, to more complicated recipes there can be lanes of steps happening simultaenously - merging back together again
- This sequence will then be used in the assistant module to guide the user through the sequence of cooking, allowing them to set adjustable timers and the receipe itself with being able to swap sections in and out based on what ingredients / utensils you have
